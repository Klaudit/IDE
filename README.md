IDE
===
 
Koding's new IDE (which is built on top of Ace) has been overhauled. Much more to come but in the meanwhile, you can enjoy these features immediately:

1. Split pane views: Supports both horizontal and vertical splits. And you can merge them all back too.
2. Split IDE and Terminal: Both are on the same screen now, no more switching back and forth!
3. Shortcuts: Never take your hands off your keyboard again (at least while on Koding).
4. Workspaces: Most of you who wrote in with feature requests wanted this. Workspaces allow you to nicely collect all project related files into a folder and work on them as a collection. They also show up nicely under each VM for easy access.4j9AeQM
5. Drawing board: When you want to make a quick mind map of your ideas or just have some goofy fun!
6. New file search: Search anywhere and everywhere. Get to the file or keyword you want, fast!
